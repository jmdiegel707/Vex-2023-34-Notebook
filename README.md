#### About the Team

__About Isaac:__ I am a sophmore in highschool. I play tennis on the Caledonia Varsity team. I also do marching band where I play the Bari Saxophone. I like to do cybersecurity related things as a hobby along with playing video games.

__About James:__ I am also a sophmore at Caledonia. I'm on JV Tennis, Sypmphony Orchestra, and Vex Robotics! Originally in sixth grade, I joined robotics, introducing me to coding and putting me on my path to study software design past high school.

First Practice

The first practice we picked our team name and the color of our shirts. Later in the first practice we did some brainstorming and planning for the building of our robot

#### September 5, 2023
Second Practice

The second practice we started constructing our base along with deciding to do mecanum wheels for better side to side mobility. We got the base done along with the wheels and electronics attached. We got the coding done and did some driving.

#### September 12, 2023
Third Practice

The third practice we decided to have an outside bar to protect our wheels more. We deconstructed our robot and re-cut and fit it so that we could have wheel protection. We designed it in a way to have more strength, but also be able to go over the center bar. The design we settled on met all current requirements.

Fourth Practice

The fourth practice we finalized coding and got all of the special coding for mecanum wheels done. We then decided to create a pusher on the front desinged for ease of pushing blocks around and to be able to effectivly push them over the middle bar.

Fifth Practice

The fifth practice we got measurements and materials for building the pusher. With a little bit of tweaking we were able to add on the additions and test them out. They worked succesfully and we spent the practice testing mobility and how we could easily move blocks around. We also thought about some strategys.

#### September 26, 2023
Sixth Practice

The sixth practice we brainstormed ideas for being able to climb and the best way to do it. We came up with a couple different designs but didn't settle on one.

#### September 28, 2023
Seventh Practice

The seventh practice we continued to brainstorm and got an idea we think will work. We just have to figure out how to attach it to our robot because currently our design doesn't fit the idea very well.

Eighth Practice
